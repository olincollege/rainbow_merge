    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p> Rainbow Merge begins with the player controlling a colored, square block positioned at the center of the screen. <br>
        As the game progresses, the player has to maneuver blocks of various colors to descend from above the game screen, <br>
        and the player must strategically place their blocks to merge to form new colors in the color sequence of the rainbow. <br>
        With each successful merge, the player earns points as the colors of the blocks change from red to purple, <br>
        and advances closer to creating the coveted Midnight Prism, the ultimate goal of the game.  <br>
        However, the game also concludes when the stack of merged blocks extends beyond the boundaries of the game screen. <br>
        This occurs when the height of the merged blocks reaches a critical threshold, <br>
        preventing further stacking within the confines of the game environment. <br>
        Ending the player's journey and signaling game over.
    </p>

    <h2>Game Controls</h2>
    <p>
    A Key: Move piece to the left.<br>
    D Key: Move piece to the right.<br>
    S Key: Drop the block.<br>
    In Rainbow Merge, players control colorful blocks using the ASD keys, <br>
    navigating it left and right on the top of the game screen, <br>
    then dropping them to merge with other blocks of the same color. <br>
    The block's movement wraps around at the edge of the screen, <br>
    so the player can easily move from one side of the screen to the opposite side creating a seamless gaming experience. <br>
    </p>
